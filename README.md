# Neural Network controlled autonomous driving RC-Car
## About
A project agreed upon by students from Munich University of Applied Sciences  
to create a neural network controlled autonomous driving RC-Car in effort to  
acquire practical experience in machine learning.
##Requirements
Arduino - Allows the driver to send commands to the car via a serial interface.  
Train   - Neural network code written in Python to train with backpropagation
